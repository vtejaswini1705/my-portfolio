✅ Multi-page layout  
✅ Responsive design & mobile friednly  
✅ Simple & modern technologies (React, JavaScript, and SCSS)  

## Quick Setup

1. This application requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). To check if you have Node.js installed, run:

    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

2. In the project directory, run the following code to install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the app in the development mode by using:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

5. Once you complete the above process, navigate to `/src/components` directory. You will find all the pages and components used within the template. You can modify texts, pictures, and other information to your own.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Deployment

You can choose your favorite service (e.g., [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Render](https://render.com/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)) for deployment. One of the easiest ways to host this portfolio is using GitHub pages. Follow the instructions below to complete the production deploy.

1. Set Up GitHub Repository

    Navigate to GitHub and create a new repository for the portfolio app.

2. Configure `package.json`

    In your `package.json` file, edit the following properties:

    ```json
    {
        "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name",
        "scripts": {
            "predeploy": "npm run build",
            "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
            ...
        }
    }
    ```

    Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username and `your-repo-name` with the name of your GitHub repository.

3. Deploy to GitHub Pages

    Now you're ready to deploy your app. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```

4. Access Your Deployed App

    After successfully deploying your app, you can access it at `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name`.
