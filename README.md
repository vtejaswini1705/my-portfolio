## Features

‚úÖ Open source (free to use, no attribution required)  
‚úÖ Responsive design & mobile-friendly  
‚úÖ Supports both dark and light modes  
‚úÖ Highly customizable multi-component layout  
‚úÖ Built with modern technologies (React, TypeScript, JavaScript, and SCSS)  

## Quick Setup

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Check your installation by running:

    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

2. In the project directory, install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

5. Customize the template by navigating to the `/src/components` directory. Modify texts, pictures, and other information as needed.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## Deployment

You can choose your preferred service (e.g., [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Render](https://render.com/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)) for deployment. One of the easiest ways to host this portfolio is using GitHub Pages. Follow the instructions below for a production deploy.

1. **Set Up GitHub Repository**

    Create a new repository on GitHub for your portfolio app.

2. **Configure `package.json`**

    Edit the following properties in your `package.json` file:

    ```json
    {
        "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name",
        "scripts": {
            "predeploy": "npm run build",
            "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
            ...
        }
    }
    ```

    Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username and `your-repo-name` with the name of your GitHub repository.

3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**

    Run the following command to deploy your app:

    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```

4. **Access Your Deployed App**
