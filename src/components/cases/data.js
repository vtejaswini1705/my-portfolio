        problem: 'Student-led digital marketing agency, b digital, was required to raise awareness and attendance at the annual Asia Pacific Career Conference held at Brigham Young University - Hawaii. The agency was concerned that students may not be very interested in joining APCC even though it is a prestigious opportunity for every student to participate in their future career.',
        solution: 'First, my team used Instagram reels in the process of social media marketing. Based on the previous data obtained at school, we identified that one of the most effective methods is to show which companies are attending the conference. The goal of this reel was to get students excited about the event by showing the list of companies that are attending APCC. Second, we created more engaging texts to go on the official APCC website. One of the things that the APCC website lacks was adding quotes and testimonials from the students who enjoyed APCC. If we add their experiences to the website, we will increase interest from students. It will help students feel related to the content and be engaged in the event. Lastly, we planned for “Pop Up" event at various BYUH locations: 4 locations are effective for students and faculty members of BYUH who will be curious and excited for the APCC event. Four locations are selected, and those are the most common areas where they will be around to see and to be able to promote APCC.',
        results: 'My team increased the event attendance by 15%, and more than 30 students are certified for the conference.',

        problem: 'There are lack of numbers of digital community that specializes in coding, software development, and IT.',
        solution: 'I created an Instagram account @hawaii.codes that is targeted for people who learn programming/coding. The plan to grow the audience includes categorizing stories, for example, "coding tips", "helpful tools", and "Q&A". I used hashtags including #peoplewhocode, #coding, #daysofcode, and #programmerlifestyle that are trending among the other communities.',
        results: 'I reached 15.4K accounts, received 408 engagements, and 423 total followers since the official launch on January 31st, 2022. One reel was played over 10,500 times, and the post was saved by 103 accounts.',

        image: 'https://yuji-aws-bucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/susan-q-yin-2JIvboGLeho-unsplash.jpg',
        problem: 'Data science is an emerging field in Japan, and therefore, there is a lack of learning resources in the Japanese language. Learners also struggle to find time to take courses with affordable cost (average cost for taking online data science courses in Japan is approximately $2,471).',
        solution: 'I created a learning management systems (LMS) that provides high-quality, data science focused learning resources in Japanese. This web service can be accessed from any desktop or mobile device. I partnered with other professionals who work in the field of data science and can teach on the platform. I participated in this project as a full-stack developer and built the platform from scratch using Ruby on Rails, HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, AWS, and PostgreSQL.',
        results: 'I obtained approximately 300 users on the site, and increased awareness of data science in Japan.',

        image: 'https://yuji-aws-bucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/carlos-muza-hpjSkU2UYSU-unsplash.jpg',
        problem: 'Brigham Young University – Hawaii and its departments (Ho’okele, Admissions, International Student Services (ISS), Travel Services, and Residential Services) were experiencing difficulty in the onboarding process of new students. As the school was reopening after the remote learning situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the institution had expected more students to be back on campus. The departments were required to onboard the students more efficiently and provide data to track them to more effectively bring them back to campus by Fall 2021.',
        solution: 'I created an overall dashboard by using the business inteligence tool Domo to virtualize the onboarding process. Through this dashboard, each department was able to identify the pain point of the process and move the process forward.',
        results: 'My team improved the on-boarding process of new students that coming to BYUH campus by 70%. We laid foundation for future employees by providing a documentation of Domo dashboards.',
