        problem: 'Student-led digital marketing agency, b digital, was required to raise awareness and attendance at the annual Asia Pacific Career Conference held at Brigham Young University - Hawaii. The agency had concern that students may not be very interested in joining APCC even though it is a prestigious opportunity for every student to participate in their future career.',
        solution: 'As a first solution, my team used Instagram reels in the process of social media marketing. Based on the previous data obtained at school, we identified that one of the most effective methods is to show what companies that are attending the conference. The goal of this reel is to get students excited about the event by showing the list of companies that are attending APCC. Second, we created more engaging texts to go on the official APCC website. One of the things that the APCC website lacks is adding quotes and testimonials from the students who enjoyed APCC. If we add their experiences to the website, we will increase interest from students. It will help students feel related to the content and be engaged in the event. Lastly, we planned for “Pop Up" event at various BYUH locations: 4 locations are effective for students and faculty members of BYUH who will be curious and excited for the APCC event. Four locations are selected, and those are the most common areas where they will be around to see and to be able to promote APCC.',
        results: 'Increased the event attendance by 15%. More than 30 students are certified for the conference.'

        problem: 'Lack of numbers of digital community that specializes in coding, software development, and IT.',
        solution: 'Created an Instagram account @hawaii.codes that is targeted for people who learn programming/coding. The plan to grow the audience includes categorizing stories into several categories such as "coding tips", "helpful tools", and "Q&A". Used hashtags including #peoplewhocode, #coding, #daysofcode, and #programmerlifestyle that are trending among the other communities.',
        results: 'Reached 15.4K accounts, received 408 engagements, and 423 total followers since the official launch on January 31st, 2022. One reel was played over 10,500 times, and the post was saved by 103 accounts.'

        image: 'https://yuji-aws-bucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/susan-q-yin-2JIvboGLeho-unsplash.jpg',
        problem: 'In Japan, the field of data science is newly introduced, and therefore, there is a lack of learning resources in the Japanese language. Learners also struggle to find time to take courses with affordable cost (average cost for taking online data science courses in Japan is approximately $2,471).',
        solution: 'Created a learning management systems (LMS) that provides high-quality, data science focused learning resources in Japan. This web service can be accessed from any desktop or mobile devices. I partnered with other professionals who work in the field of data science and can teach on the platform. I participated in this project as a full-stack developer and built the platform from scratch using Ruby on Rails, HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, AWS, and PostgreSQL.',
        results: 'Obtained approximately 300 users on the site. Increased awareness of data science in Japan.'

        image: 'https://yuji-aws-bucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/carlos-muza-hpjSkU2UYSU-unsplash.jpg',
        problem: 'Brigham Young University – Hawaii and its departments (Ho’okele, Admissions, International Student Services (ISS), Travel Services, and Residential Services) was experiencing difficulty in the onboarding process of new students. As the school reopens after the remote learning situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the institution expects more students to be back on campus. If the process of students on board is still slow, it will cause problems that the school will have not enough students. The departments are required to onboard the students more efficiently and provide data to track them to more effectively bring them back to campus by Fall 2021.',
        solution: 'Created an overall dashboard by using the business inteligence tool Domo to virtualize the onboarding process. Through this dashboard, each department can clearly identify the pain point of the process and move the process forward.',
        results: 'Improved the on-boarding process of new students that coming to BYUH campus by 70%. Laid foundation for future employees by providing a documentation of Domo dashboards.'
