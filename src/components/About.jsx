            I graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science 
            from Brigham Young University - Hawaii. As a former full stack engineer, 
            I collaborated with agile teams to deliver 5+ RESTful web applications for a 
            diverse population of 3,200 customers. My expertise includes full stack development, 
            DevOps, data governance, and project management.
