          <h1>Hi, I'm Yuji 👋</h1>
          <p>I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science at Brigham Young University - Hawaii (Expected graduation April 2022). I also work as a developer/analyst at my university's Enterprise Information Systems department, developing enterprise-grade software for a diverse population of 3,200 customers. Throughout my career, I have always found it rewarding to understand the needs of each client and solve their problems through the use of emerging technology.</p>
