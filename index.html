          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Hi, my name is Yuji. 
            I am an experienced developer with a demonstrated history of working in the higher education industry. I am skilled in a variety of programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, Swift, HTML, CSS, software development, and data analysis. I am a strong business development professional with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Brigham Young University - Hawaii.<br/><br>
            While in the fifth grade, my father let me use his desktop PC for the first time. There was an application installed on the computer called “Homepage Builder”, which helps clients to build their own web pages. I immediately fell in love with the software and created my very first website when I was 12. Since then, my passion for computers and advanced technology has grown and guided me to pursue a career in computer science. To further my knowledge and support my academic pursuits, I worked in a variety of positions, such as a backend web developer, Python developer, and data analyst.</p>

              (January 2020 - Current)</h2>
            <p>As a web developer, I implemented the recently created Brightspot CMS to improve the overall design of the school website of Brigham Young University - Hawaii by using Handlebars, LESS, JSON, JavaScript, and HTML. One of the highlights of this project was to reinvent the "Holokai Program of Study Module", which loads the CSV file of various areas of studies and lists all the majors available at the university. By implementing a more modern user interface (UX) and design, we achieved 13% higher website traffic.</p>

              (January 2020 - Current)</h2>
            <p>I worked as a Python developer for a real estate company in Japan. To help those who struggle to find housing in Japan, I used a multi-regression analysis to find a coefficient correlation from over 8000000 housing listings on Japan's No. 1 real estate website. Based on the data, I was able to provide specific housing recommendations according to clients’ unique needs accurately through statistical analysis.</p><br>
